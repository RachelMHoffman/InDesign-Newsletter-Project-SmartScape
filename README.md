<h1 style="font-size: 20px">SMARTSCAPE - <i>Smart Home Technology Company's Subscriber Email Newsletter</i> - 2024</h1>
<h2 style="font-size: 18px">PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
The following is an email newsletter design concept, made for a fictional smart home software company named SmartScape. I designed it based on a randomized design prompt generated through ChatGPT. The prompt was structured as an email from SmartScape, requesting an email newsletter for their subscribers. The request specified the client's wants and needs, such as the written content and visual branding guidelines. I created the prototype in Adobe InDesign using inspiration from real B-to-C newsletters I've received and designs found being praised online in digital marketing blogs. For the more intricately-shaped elements, I made and imported them from Adobe Illustrator. I did not start the design process out from a time-saving template, since I wanted to get more out of the experience and demonstrate more of my own work for those visiting my portfolio.
